To use Firebase in a web app
=================================

Copy and paste these scripts into the bottom of your <body> tag, but before you use any Firebase services:


<!-- The core Firebase JS SDK is always required and must be listed first -->
<script src="/__/firebase/8.4.2/firebase-app.js"></script>

<!-- TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
     https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries -->
<script src="/__/firebase/8.4.2/firebase-analytics.js"></script>

<!-- Initialize Firebase -->
<script src="/__/firebase/init.js"></script>


At Local machine
##################

Install NodeJS and NPM
========================

Debian's default NodeJS is 10 and there is a incompatibility between NPM and NodeJS in Deb10.

Trying to use node snap specified at nodejs.org also fails, with "/ has 'other' write 40777"

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install snapd
	# In chromebook additionally need to install this
	sudo apt install libsquashfuse0 squashfuse fuse
	sudo snap install core
	sudo snap install node --classic

Had to install the lts binary packages for debian specified in nodejs.org

	wget https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x
	sudo bash setup_lts.x
	sudo apt install nodejs


Install Firebase CLI
======================

sudo npm install -g firebase-tools

This also modifies some files under /root/.npm among others. THought of using 'n' package in npm.
But its use didnt seem clean, so reverted and went back to installing firebase-tools directly as
a global package. NOTE: Remember to pass -g to uninstall also, otherwise it wont uninstall from
/usr/lib/node_modules.

There were some errors seen when installing, need to look at that later.


Use Firebase CLI
==================

NOTE: Best run these within the directory which will contain the files
related to the firebase project/app.

firebase login

firebase projects:list

firebase apps:list --project hosp-beds-covid-in

firebase init

firebase auth:export --format json tocheck/auth.export.json

Misc: sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre

firebase emulators:start

Misc: Add set modeline and syntax on to ~/.vimrc

Open a browser and load the local url specified when emulators got started.

Update public/index.html as required.

Update firestore.rules as required.


Create Admin tool
===================

NOTE: Run these npm commands in the directory which will contain the
project/program code/files.

npm init

	meta data for a new package/program is captured and saved.

npm install firebase-admin --save

	bring in the bazooka, to administer firebase applications.

Use Environment variables to either specify the service auth token and
or for targetting the local emulators, instead of the server.
